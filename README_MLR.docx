# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Assignment

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **"MLR Assignment.ipynb"**, which demonstrates the implementation of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) using a dataset. The notebook focuses on building, evaluating, and interpreting the MLR model to understand the relationships between predictor variables and the target variable.

---

## Features of the Notebook

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Loading and exploring the dataset.
  - Checking for and handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets.

- **Model Building**:
  - Implementing Multiple Linear Regression using scikit-learn.
  - Training the model on the training dataset.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as:
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    - R-squared value
  - Comparing predicted values with actual values.

- **Feature Importance**:
  - Analyzing the significance of each independent variable in predicting the dependent variable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
